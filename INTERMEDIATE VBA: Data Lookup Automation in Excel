' === Sample Data for "Book2.xlsx" ===
'
' Let's assume you have a workbook named "Book2.xlsx" with the following data in "Sheet1":
'
' | G       | H       | I       | J       |
' |---------|---------|---------|---------|
' | (empty) | TruckID | Location| YRET    |
' | 1       | TRK001  | NY      | 1000    |
' | 2       | TRK002  | LA      | 2000    |
' | 3       | TRK003  | SF      | 3000    |
'
' In this scenario:
' - Column H contains Truck IDs.
' - Column I contains Locations.
' - Column J contains YRET values.
'
' === How the Code Works ===
'
' 1. **Calling the Function**: When you use the `YRETTRUCK` function in a cell, it retrieves the value from the cell two columns to the left of where the function is called.
'
' 2. **Referencing "Book2"**: The function attempts to find and reference a workbook named "Book2.xlsx." If this workbook is not open, the function returns a `#REF!` error.
'
' 3. **Setting the Lookup Range**: The function defines the lookup range as columns H through J in "Sheet1" of "Book2.xlsx". 
'
' 4. **Performing the VLOOKUP**: The function performs a VLOOKUP based on the lookup value (e.g., the TruckID) and returns the corresponding YRET value from column J.
'
' 5. **Handling Errors**: If any error occurs during the VLOOKUP (e.g., if the lookup value is not found), the function returns a `#VALUE!` error.
'
' 6. **Adding Function Description**: The `YRETTRUCKFunctionDescription` subroutine adds a description to the `YRETTRUCK` function so that when users use this function in Excel, they see a helpful description.
'
' === How to Use This Function ===
'
' 1. Ensure that "Book2.xlsx" is open.
' 2. Place the `YRETTRUCK` function in a cell that has the TruckID two columns to the left (in the same row).
' 3. The function will return the corresponding YRET value from "Book2.xlsx".
'
' This function is useful for performing lookups in an external workbook and is especially handy when dealing with multiple workbooks in complex data models.
