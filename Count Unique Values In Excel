Example Data (in range A1
):
A1: KDD 086Z
A2: KAX 230U
A3: KBP 348E
A4: KBQ 708U
A5: KDD 086Z
A6: KBP 348E
A7: KBJ 239D
A8: KBQ 708U
A9: KBJ 239D
A10: KAX 230U

Applying the Formula:
Step 1: MATCH(A1:A10, A1:A10, 0)
This returns the positions of the first occurrence of each value in the range A1:A10:
{1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3, 7, 4, 7, 2}
Explanation:
KDD 086Z is found first at A1, so its first occurrence is 1.
KAX 230U is first found at A2, so its first occurrence is 2.
KBP 348E is first found at A3, so its first occurrence is 3.
KBQ 708U is first found at A4, so its first occurrence is 4.
KBJ 239D is first found at A7, so its first occurrence is 7.

Step 2: FREQUENCY(..., ...)
The FREQUENCY function then calculates how many times each unique position occurs:
{2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0}
Explanation:
Position 1 appears twice (for KDD 086Z).
Position 2 appears twice (for KAX 230U).
Position 3 appears twice (for KBP 348E).
Position 4 appears twice (for KBQ 708U).
Position 7 appears twice (for KBJ 239D).
All other positions return 0 because they are duplicates.

Step 3: IF(FREQUENCY(...) > 0, 1)
Convert the frequency array to 1 for each unique value:
{1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0}
Explanation:
For positions with frequencies greater than 0, IF returns 1.
Duplicates result in 0.

Step 4: SUM(...)
Summing these values gives the count of unique items:
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
Final Result:
The formula =SUM(IF(FREQUENCY(MATCH(A1:A10,A1:A10,0),MATCH(A1:A10,A1:A10,0))>0,1)) will return 5, which is the count of unique values in the range A1:A10.
Unique Values in the Example:
KDD 086Z
KAX 230U
KBP 348E
KBQ 708U
KBJ 239D
These are the 5 unique values counted by the formula.
